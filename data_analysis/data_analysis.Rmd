## Introduction, Preliminary Analysis and Definitions

In this notebook, we are analyzing Maryland precinct data from the 2020 and 2024 elections. To do this, we have loaded in 2 data sets from the Maryland State Board of Elections. 

The 2020 data set has 23 columns and 95283 rows. 
The 2024 data set has 21 columns and 117875 rows. 
Both data sets show each precinct, information about the precinct, each race, each candidate, the winner, how many votes each candidate received and method of vote. 

Because each year has different candidates and different races, we should identify which races happened both years and in all counties in order to make a clear analysis. We should also identify clear candidates in each race so that we aren't analyzing someone who is listed, but received one write in vote, for example.

To meet these parameters, we will focus on the race for president because it happened both years and in every precinct. In terms of candidates, we will focus on Donald Trump and Joe Biden for 2020 and Kamala Harris and Donald Trump for 2024.

We should be able to answer most of our questions with this data. However, we will need to load in data from the census in order to answer questions about economic status and identify. I don't know how easy that will be to do by precinct, but we'll see. We'll also need to include information about eligible voters and registered voters to determine turnout.

## Questions to answer
In this notebook, we are answering five questions about the data.

### Question 1

* **Question**: Which precincts experienced the most significant change in party support? 

* **Analysis summary**: 

```{r}
#Summarize votes by party (2020)
votes_2020 <- precincts_combined |>
  filter(year == 2020) |>
  group_by(election_district_precinct, county_name, party) |>
  summarize(total_votes_2020 = sum(total,na.rm = TRUE), .groups= "drop")

#Summarize votes by party (2024)
votes_2024 <- precincts_combined |>
  filter(year == 2024) |>
  group_by(election_district_precinct, county_name, party) |>
  summarize(total_votes_2024 = sum(total, na.rm=TRUE), .groups="drop")

#Join 2020 and 2024 datasets by party and precinct 
vote_changes <- left_join(votes_2020, votes_2024, by = c("election_district_precinct", "county_name", "party"))

#Democrat percent change 
democratic_changes <- vote_changes |>
  filter(party == "DEM") |>
  mutate(
    percent_change = ((total_votes_2024 - total_votes_2020) / total_votes_2020) * 100
  ) |>
  select(election_district_precinct, county_name, percent_change) |>
  arrange(desc(percent_change))

#Republican percent change 
republican_changes <- vote_changes |>
  filter(party == "REP") |>
  mutate(
    percent_change = ((total_votes_2024 - total_votes_2020) / total_votes_2020) * 100 
  ) |>
  select(election_district_precinct, county_name, percent_change) |>
  arrange(desc(percent_change))
```








### Question 2

* **Question**: How did voter turnout vary across precincts? What factors contributed to this? 

* **Analysis summary**: 

```{r}


```





### Question 3

* **Question**: How did early voting and mail-in ballots influence precinct-level results? 


* **Analysis summary**: 

```{r}
#summarize votes by method in 2020
methods_2020 <- precincts_combined |>
  filter(year == 2020) |>

    .groups = "drop"
    ) |>
  mutate(year=2024)

methods_combined <- bind_rows (methods_2020, methods_2024)


#calculate percentage difference
methods_combined <- methods_combined |>
  mutate(
    early_percent = early/total,
    mail_in_percent = (mail_in_1 + mail_in_2) / total,
    provisional_percent = provisional / total
  )

methods_combined <- methods_combined |>
  group_by(year, party) |>
  summarise(
    average_early = mean(early_percent, na.rm = TRUE),
    average_mail = mean(mail_in_percent, na.rm = TRUE),
    average_provisional = mean(provisional_percent, na.rm = TRUE),

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
