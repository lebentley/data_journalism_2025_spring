#Quote 1:"Similar shares agreed that more information about the candidates from unbiased sources (51 percent) or early in-person voting (52 percent) would help, too."

#Information about candidates from unbiased sources
voting_data |>
  group_by(Q19_2) |>
  summarise(
    number_of_respondents = n()) |>
  mutate(percentage = (number_of_respondents / 5836) * 100)

#Early in-person voting

  group_by(Q19_6) |>
  summarise(
    number_of_respondents = n()) |>
   mutate(percentage = (number_of_respondents / 5836) * 100)
```

About 51.7% of those surveyed who were asked whether information about candidates from unbiased sources would help said yes. About 53.6% of those surveyed who were asked whether early in-person voting would help said yes.

#Quote 2: "In any given election, between 35 and 60 percent of eligible voters don’t cast a ballot. It’s not that hard to understand why. Our system doesn’t make it particularly easy to vote, and the decision to carve out a few hours to cast a ballot requires a sense of motivation that’s hard for some Americans to muster every two or four years — enthusiasm about the candidates, belief in the importance of voting itself, a sense that anything can change as the result of a single vote. “I guess I just don’t think that one person’s vote can swing an election,” said Jon Anderson, who won’t be voting for president this year because of moral objections to both candidates."

On average, 28.5% of voters did not vote in any given election. This does not line up with the article's clam that the number is closer to at least 35%, but it is what the data showed. With non-voting percentages of 28% in the 2018 midterms, 17% in the 2016 presidential election, 35% in the 2014 midterms, 23% in the 2012 presidential election, 39% in the 2010 midterms and 29% in the 2008 presidential election, the average non-voting percentage is 28.5%. So the 35 to 60% mark indicated in the article could not be perfectly replicated, but I got pretty close.

#Quote 3: "On the whole, though, those who don’t vote as frequently didn’t view methods of voting — like in-person voting or mail-in ballots — all that differently than people who always vote. Nonvoters, on the other hand, trusted these methods less across the board." I used ChatGPT on certain parts of this question, in order to get the mutate and categorize voters. It was also used on filter.
voting_data <- voting_data |>
    mutate(voter_group = case_when(
    Q21 == 2 ~ "Nonvoter",  # Q21 = 2 means "No, I don't plan to vote"
    Q26 %in% c(1, 2) ~ "Frequent Voter",
    Q26 %in% c(3, 4) ~ "Infrequent Voter",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_
  ))


voting_data |>
  filter(!is.na(voter_group), !is.na(Q24)) |>
  group_by(voter_group, Q24) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") |>
  mutate(percentage = count / sum(count) * 100)
```
In this output:
  1 = mail-in or absentee ballot
  2 = In-person before election day
  3 = In-person on election day
  4 = Other

This code labels those who say they always or sometimes vote in national elections as "Frequent Voters", and those who say they vote rarely or not at all are labeled as "Infrequent Voters." If they don't plan to vote, they were labeled as a non-voter. We were able to prove this sentence, which claimed that attitudes towards different methods of voting, such as mail-in or in-person, changed if you were a non-voter.  You can see that frequent voters, for example, prefer a mail-in or absentee ballot generally. However, that preference decreases as they become an infrequent voter, and gets even lower among non-voters. For example, 34.1% of frequent voters in this survey said their preferred method of voting would be mail-in or absentee ballots. However, only 2.6% of Nonvoters said that would be their preferred method (this is their preferred method if they were to cast a vote, it disregards whether or not they actually plan on voting).


```{r}
#Quote 4: “For instance, people who vote more irregularly are a little more likely than those who almost always vote to have lost a job in the past year (13 percent vs. 10 percent) or to have worried about expenses (21 percent vs. 16 percent)” ChatGPT was used to answer parts of this question, mainly in the filer and group_by sections.

#Lost a job in the past year
voting_data |>
  group_by(Q11_1) |>
  summarise(
    number_of_respondents = n()) |>
  mutate(percentage = (number_of_respondents / 5836) * 100)

#Worried about expenses in the past year
voting_data |>
  group_by(Q11_5) |>
  summarise(
    number_of_respondents = n()) |>
  mutate(percentage = (number_of_respondents / 5836) * 100)
```

13% of people lost a job in the past year. 22% worried about expenses in the past year.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
