#Quote 1: "Similar shares agreed that more information about the candidates from unbiased sources (51 percent) or early in-person voting (52 percent) would help, too."

```

About 51.7% of those surveyed who were asked whether information about candidates from unbiased sources would help said yes. About 53.6% of those surveyed who were asked whether early in-person voting would help said yes. This lines up closely with the articles' numbers of 51% and 52%.

#Quote 2: "In any given election, between 35 and 60 percent of eligible voters don’t cast a ballot. It’s not that hard to understand why. Our system doesn’t make it particularly easy to vote, and the decision to carve out a few hours to cast a ballot requires a sense of motivation that’s hard for some Americans to muster every two or four years — enthusiasm about the candidates, belief in the importance of voting itself, a sense that anything can change as the result of a single vote. “I guess I just don’t think that one person’s vote can swing an election,” said Jon Anderson, who won’t be voting for president this year because of moral objections to both candidates."

total_respondents <- nrow(voting_data)

On average, 28.5% of voters did not vote in any given election. This does not line up with the article's clam that the number is closer to at least 35%, but it is what the data showed. With non-voting percentages of 27.2% in the 2018 midterms, 17.3% in the 2016 presidential election, 34.1% in the 2014 midterms, 23.1% in the 2012 presidential election, 38.9% in the 2010 midterms and 28.8% in the 2008 presidential election, the average non-voting percentage is 28.2%. So the 35 to 60% mark indicated in the article could not be perfectly replicated, but I got pretty close.


```{r}
#Quote 3: "And if that happens, it could be due in large part to the fact that a lot of people who vote only sometimes cast a ballot this year. According to our survey, 82 percent of these voters are following the 2020 election somewhat or very closely, and 93 percent are planning to vote in 2020."

total_respondents <- nrow(voting_data |>
  filter(voter_category == "sporadic"))

#How closely are you following the election
voting_data |>
  filter(voter_category == "sporadic") |>
  group_by(Q25) |>
  summarise(
    number_of_respondents = n()) |>
  mutate(percentage = (number_of_respondents / total_respondents) * 100)

#Plan to vote
voting_data |>
  filter(voter_category == "sporadic") |>
  group_by(Q21) |>
  summarise(
    number_of_respondents = n()) |>
  mutate(percentage = (number_of_respondents / total_respondents) * 100)
```

First, we had to filter by respondents who were "sporadic" voters. After doing that, we can see what percentage of them are following the 2020 election closely or somewhat closely (the code gave us 83%. The article gave us 82%) and what percentage of them said they will vote (the code gave us 93.4% while the article gave us 93%).

#Quote 4: “For instance, people who vote more irregularly are a little more likely than those who almost always vote to have lost a job in the past year (13 percent vs. 10 percent) or to have worried about expenses (21 percent vs. 16 percent)”

total_sporadic <- nrow(voting_data |>
  filter(voter_category == "sporadic"))

total_always <- nrow(voting_data |>
  filter(voter_category == "always"))

#Lost a job in the past year and vote irregularly

  filter(voter_category == ("sporadic")) |>
  group_by(Q11_1) |>
  summarise(
    number_of_respondents = n()) |>
  mutate(percentage = (number_of_respondents / total_sporadic) * 100)

#Lost a job in the past year and almost always vote

#Worried about expenses in the past year and vote irregularly

  mutate(percentage = (number_of_respondents / total_always) * 100)
```

13% of people who vote irregularly lost a job in the past year. 10% of people who always vote lost a job in the past year. 21%  of people who vote irregularly worried about expenses in the past year. 15.4% of people who always vote worried about expenses in the past year.

total_black <- nrow(voting_data |>

```

Outputs 4 and 5 in the data correspond to "The Republican Party does not want people like me to vote, but does not work hard to keep us from voting" and "The Republican Party does not want people like me to vote, and works hard to keep us from being able to vote." You can lump these two responses together as people who say the Republican Party does not want people like them to vote.

For Black respondents, the percentage output for response 4 and 5 totals up to 59.8% (article says 54%, but it is close enough). For Hispanic respondents, the percentage output for response 4 and 5 totals up to 34.3% (article says 35%). For White respondents, the percentage output for 4 and 5 totals up to 25.9% (article says 26%).

Memo:
The main findings of the article summarize the complexities of voting, and do a statistical analysis on what factors are likely to influence voting. They found that most voters will fit into one of three categories: those who frequently vote, those who sometimes vote, and those who almost never vote. They quote many Americans who felt like their votes mattered at different points, and who felt like the impact of their vote varied based on each election. However, there were also common barriers that, in some instances, prevented Americans from voting. Some of these include waiting in line for more than an hour, missed voter registration deadlines, and couldn’t find their polling place. Furthermore, there are some systemic issues that have a correlation with infrequent voting. For example, occasional voters were slightly more likely than frequent voters to have a long term disability, etc. Black and Hispanic people are also more likely to experience barriers, with one being that there are typically fewer polling places in their neighborhoods. Mainly, the article exemplified how a culmination of different factors often affect Americans’ attitudes, likeliness, and ability to vote. Beyond the data findings, the reporters on this story let the voters speak for themselves which gave a unique and individualized voice to the story. They used a lot of direct quotes and highlighted information about the voters occupations, backgrounds, etc. This helped humanize the voters and demonstrated the impact of the data that was mentioned in the story. This approach was extremely effective because while showcasing their data reporting, they were also able to add a human interest element. It allowed readers to see why the story should matter to them - because they can likely relate to one of the many voters interviewed. Ultimately, the data and interviews were brought together in a very cohesive and well-written manner. The reporters communicated specific data findings largely through displaying charts and graphics throughout the article. The charts were easily readable and understandable. However, I believe there was a chance they could’ve improved their reporting by specifying categories such as “sometimes votes.” There was not always a clear differentiation between what voting only sometimes looks like compared to frequent voters. They did try to communicate this by saying it is defined as “voted in at least two elections,” but that can vary for different reasons among age, etc. Furthermore, they should also account that some who might not partake in smaller, local elections could still consider themselves a frequent voter if they participate in national elections. They communicated possible flaws and shortcomings through clarifications about graphs, and the categories that defined their data. Overall, the way the data was presented was clear and concise for readers. Additionally, the data from this project came from a poll of about 8,000 people - nearly 6,000 of whom were able to match voting history. The reporters did create the poll themselves.  Within the data, there was definitely extensive work done to ensure that certain numbers and information were protected. Within the columns that were listed, you had data that was separated by month and what looked liked either separated by day or by week. This went from January to November (all the way up until election day). They also had two columns listed (“Respid” and “weight”) that really also gave little context to what was being presented. After doing this project, we understand that there are times where data can be misleading, there are times that data can be confusing, but it is more so about discovering what certain data means. This project taught our group that no matter the circumstance, you have to figure out and discover data. There were times where it took us hours to finish one question, but once we finished, not only did we learn so much, we learned new things and how to solve certain problems in the future. The three of us working together not only allowed us to collaborate on other ideas, but also contribute our thoughts and understandings with each other. All of us getting to understand the data and read the data, not only that but solving the data really helped the experience, and allowed us to understand it better. Not only that, but it allows us to learn from one another. If one of us is doing a certain question and we are stuck, we can ask someone else. Overall, this experience taught our group how to work with each other when collaborating and working on data/decoding data/decision making on data projects, together.
