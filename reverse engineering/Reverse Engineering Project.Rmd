#Quote 1: "Similar shares agreed that more information about the candidates from unbiased sources (51 percent) or early in-person voting (52 percent) would help, too."

About 51.7% of those surveyed who were asked whether information about candidates from unbiased sources would help said yes. About 53.6% of those surveyed who were asked whether early in-person voting would help said yes. This lines up closely with the articles' numbers of 51% and 52%.

#Quote 2: "In any given election, between 35 and 60 percent of eligible voters don’t cast a ballot. It’s not that hard to understand why. Our system doesn’t make it particularly easy to vote, and the decision to carve out a few hours to cast a ballot requires a sense of motivation that’s hard for some Americans to muster every two or four years — enthusiasm about the candidates, belief in the importance of voting itself, a sense that anything can change as the result of a single vote. “I guess I just don’t think that one person’s vote can swing an election,” said Jon Anderson, who won’t be voting for president this year because of moral objections to both candidates."

total_respondents <- nrow(voting_data)

On average, 28.5% of voters did not vote in any given election. This does not line up with the article's clam that the number is closer to at least 35%, but it is what the data showed. With non-voting percentages of 27.2% in the 2018 midterms, 17.3% in the 2016 presidential election, 34.1% in the 2014 midterms, 23.1% in the 2012 presidential election, 38.9% in the 2010 midterms and 28.8% in the 2008 presidential election, the average non-voting percentage is 28.2%. So the 35 to 60% mark indicated in the article could not be perfectly replicated, but I got pretty close.


```{r}
#Quote 3: "In the survey, we asked voters who have missed at least one national election — which included some people who almost always vote — why they didn’t cast a ballot. Nearly a quarter cited some of the structural barriers we mentioned above. But another 31 percent said that they decided not to vote because they disliked the candidates or they thought nothing would change as a result of the election (26 percent)."

#How often do you vote in national elections?
total_respondents <- voting_data |>
  filter(Q26  %in%  c(2, 3, 4)) |>
  summarise(number_of_respondents = n()) |>
  pull(number_of_respondents)

#Thought nothing would change as a result of the election

```

First, we had to filter answers to Q26. Answers 2, 3 and 4 mean sometimes vote, rarely vote and never vote, respectively. We then had to calculate the number of respondents who answered 2, 3 or 4. The next part is to figure out the percentage of that population who do so because they either dislike the candidates or thought nothing would change. The tables code this out. An output of 1 means it was a reason they didn't vote. After calculating percentages, 27% of those who sometimes vote, rarely vote or never vote had disliking a candidate as a reason for nonvoting (article says 26% in the quote). 30% had thinking nothing would change as a reason for nonvoting (article says 31% in the quote).

#Quote 4: “For instance, people who vote more irregularly are a little more likely than those who almost always vote to have lost a job in the past year (13 percent vs. 10 percent) or to have worried about expenses (21 percent vs. 16 percent)”

total_sporadic <- nrow(voting_data |>
  filter(voter_category == "sporadic"))

total_always <- nrow(voting_data |>
  filter(voter_category == "always"))

#Lost a job in the past year and vote irregularly
voting_data |>
  filter(voter_category == ("sporadic")) |>
  group_by(Q11_1) |>
  summarise(
    number_of_respondents = n()) |>
  mutate(percentage = (number_of_respondents / total_sporadic) * 100)

#Worried about expenses in the past year and vote irregularly

```

13% of people who vote irregularly lost a job in the past year. 10% of people who always vote lost a job in the past year. 21%  of people who vote irregularly worried about expenses in the past year. 15.4% of people who always vote worried about expenses in the past year.

total_black <- nrow(voting_data |>

```

Outputs 4 and 5 in the data correspond to "The Republican Party does not want people like me to vote, but does not work hard to keep us from voting" and "The Republican Party does not want people like me to vote, and works hard to keep us from being able to vote." You can lump these two responses together as people who say the Republican Party does not want people like them to vote.

For Black respondents, the percentage output for response 4 and 5 totals up to 59.8% (article says 54%, but it is close enough). For Hispanic respondents, the percentage output for response 4 and 5 totals up to 34.3% (article says 35%). For White respondents, the percentage output for 4 and 5 totals up to 25.9% (article says 26%).

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
